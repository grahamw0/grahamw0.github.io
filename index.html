<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Riker Ipsum.</h3>

<p>Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Besides, you look good in a dress. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. How long can two people talk about nothing? Talk about going nowhere fast. What? We're not at all alike! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Red Alert!</h3>

<p>How long can two people talk about nothing? We have a saboteur aboard. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I am your worst nightmare! Computer, lights up! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Sorry, Data. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves?</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stroke the beard.</h3>

<p>This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Damage report! Your head is not an artifact! You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>All about Riker.</h3>

<p>Ensign Babyface! I'll be sure to note that in my log. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. We have a saboteur aboard. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I guess it's better to be lucky than good.</p>

<h3>
<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stop reading this.</h3>

<p>Well, that's certainly good to know. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules.</p>
